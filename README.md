# My Dev Ref

A personal repository I've created to aid my journey in web development, with my current focus being WordPress development. 
As I learn and grow in areas like front-end development, back-end integrations, and database management, I find myself revisiting certain concepts and techniques. 

This repository serves as a centralized location for notes and learnings that I've compiled over time.

Please note that as this repository reflects my personal learning journey, some information may evolve over time. Updates and corrections are made as my understanding deepens and technology advances.
